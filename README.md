# Overview
Using an n x n association table, associations between any 2 people can be calculated dependent on the strengths of the connections inbetween those people. Cliques can also be found where 3 or 4 people could be considered to be in a clique if they all have connections to eachother and can be grouped into Maximal or Minimal cliques. Clustering works by utilizing a technique called single-linkage clustering and a dendrogram can be formed from this where the strongest link is always added together to make new pairs.

This project was created using Netbeans 8.2 and should work if loaded straight from the download.

Source files are located in /src or refer to screenshots for insight. I have added Screenshots of the brief for this project to clear up any confusion.

Apologies for bad file and folder naming
